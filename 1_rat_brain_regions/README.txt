README

In this project data of the brain connectivity of the laboratory rat was extracted from text documents using Matlab; the data put into arelational database and finally a web application to search de DB was programmed. All the IT work was performed by me. The data itself was provided by the research group for which I was working.

Only certain files of the  code are presented and some files are only shown partially (head), especially .csv files containing brain information.
