# Monte Carlo Simulation X-Ray Detector Angiography 

Here you find Fortran77 code for the simulation of a digital angiography set up using a plexigla-iodine phantom with a beta-version of a Silicon digital detector for X-Rays. The software used for the simulation is GEANT 3.21. A document explaining the parameters ofthe simulation is provided together with a slide presentation of the results found.

The simulation is also compared to another one using a different high energy physics software as a validation (MCNP). Consitency between the two models was found. GEANT was devised for use in the high energy physics and this work shows that working above 10keV with this software gives reliable results. The simulations are also consistent with the experimental measurements.
